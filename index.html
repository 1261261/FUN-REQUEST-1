    <h1><b>What is Formula One?</b></h1>
    <p>
      Formula One (F1) is the most prestigious international open-well, single-seat racing competition.
      20 drivers (2 drivers per team) come from all around the world and race on tracks in many different countries.
    </p>
    <h1><b>The Season</b></h1>
    <p>
      Each season has around 19-24 Grand Prix races. The season usually starts in March and ends in December.
      The 2025 season had 24 races, and each race is about 300 kilometers long.
    </p>
    <h1><b>Race Weekend Time Line</b></h1>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Friday: </b>Practice sessions to learn the track and adjust the car</li>
      <li><b>Saturday: </b>Qualifying to decide starting positions</li>
      <li><b>Sunday: </b>Race day!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Some weekends also include a sprint race, which is a shorter race that gives extra points.
    </p>
    <h1><b>Point System</b></h1>
    <p>
       Points are awarded to the top 10 drivers of each race.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>25 points</li>
      <li>18 points</li>
      <li>15 points</li>
      <li>12 points</li>
      <li>10 points</li>
      <li>8 points</li>
      <li>6 points</li>
      <li>4 points</li>
      <li>2 points</li>
      <li>1 points</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      During sprint races, only the top 8 drivers earn points. First place gets 8 points, and each position after
      gets one less point, down to 1 point for 8th place.
